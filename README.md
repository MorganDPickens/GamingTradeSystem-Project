# GamingTradeSystem-Project
Hello everyone my name is Morgan Daniel Pickens. I am creating a Gaming trade system in solidity as a test to trade items between others players using a immutable hasing system.
This system will make it so that people cannot duplicate items during a trade in game. 
Secure trades so that people cannot not be scammed. 
also allow for easy tracking for trades so that admins can view what is being traded and help/look up trades if need be. 

I want to make sure this trade system is made through blockchain technology i will be making updated phases for the program daily
